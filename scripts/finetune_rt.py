"""Fine-tune AlphaPeptDeep's retention-time model on one run's own identifications.

Why this exists: the stock model's output saturates. Its top two deciles are
compressed 5x and 12x, 12.8% of a human library lands in one output bin, and no
calibration can undo that -- a monotone map can straighten a bent axis, not a
collapsed one. Measured on IH1, held-out residual falls 0.701 -> 0.449 min from
500 training peptides in 31 seconds, and afterwards a flexible calibration buys
nothing over a straight line, which is the evidence that the defect was in the
model rather than the mapping. See doc/06-rt-refinement-plan.md.

This runs OUTSIDE ODIA, in a environment carrying peptdeep and torch, and its
output is an ONNX file ODIA reads with `-rt_model`. torch never enters ODIA's
runtime.

**Modifications are resolved through alphabase's own table**, all 2,788 entries
carrying a UniMod id, rather than a hand-written dictionary. The prototype this
replaces knew five modifications and raised on the sixth; that is a fine failure
mode and a poor limit.

**Two mechanisms, both kept.** `--method direct` retrains the model to predict
normalised retention time. `--method residual` fits a calibration first --
linear, then isotonic on top of it -- and retrains only on what the calibration
could not explain, adding the two back at prediction time.

On IH1 direct won by a wide margin: held-out sd 0.429 against 0.635 at 500
peptides and 500 epochs, with residual barely beating the calibration it sits
on. **That is one file, and one file is not a result.** The likely reason is
that retargeting pretrained weights at a small centred residual fights the
initialisation rather than exploiting it -- but a different gradient, instrument
or organism could reverse it, and freezing the trunk (untested) could too. Both
mechanisms are therefore selectable, and `--evaluate` makes every run report
which one won on ITS data rather than inheriting a verdict from ours.

**The retention times must come from a search of the run being tuned for.** That
is the point -- the model learns this chromatography -- and it is also the
hazard: if those identifications came from searching with the library this model
will go on to build, the loop is closed and the FDR of the second search is no
longer independent of the first. Feeding this from an external search is safe;
feeding it from ODIA's own first pass is the case that needs the entrapment
measurement doc/06 describes. This script does not know which it has been given,
so it records the source in the sidecar and leaves the judgement to the caller.
