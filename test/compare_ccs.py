"""Compare ODIA's predicted collision cross-sections against the reference.

CCS is the third model kind, and the one the constructor used to reject: it
takes three inputs, matching neither the RT model's two nor the MS2 model's
five, so a guard written for the first two refused it outright.

Batches are mixed-length and mixed-charge on purpose. Charge is the only thing
distinguishing two rows of the same peptide, so a version that used the first
row's charge for the whole batch would agree with a single-peptide fixture.

Usage: compare_ccs.py <odia_predict_ccs> <model.onnx>
