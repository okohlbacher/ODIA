"""ODIA's iRT calibration must reproduce OpenMS's own fixture.

The fixture (src/tests/class_tests/openms/data/peptdeep_irt_peptides_predicted.csv)
carries, for the 11 Biognosys standards, both the ONNX model's raw prediction
and the calibrated iRT that AlphaPeptDeep's add_irt_column_to_precursor_df
produces from it. That makes it an independent statement about two separate
things -- our inference and our line -- from an authority neither was written
from.

The line itself is deliberately NOT pinned as a constant anywhere in ODIA: it
depends on the model checkpoint and is refitted at run time. This test pins the
line for THIS checkpoint, so a silent model swap is visible.
