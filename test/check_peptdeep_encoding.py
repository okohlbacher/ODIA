"""Guard for the PeptDeep reference encoder.

The reference is the oracle ODIA's C++ encoder is validated against, so if it
drifts, everything checked against it is confidently wrong.

The previous version of this file was near-vacuous: of 13 deliberate defects
injected into the encoder, 12 passed. Its "accumulation" assertion tested an
unmodified peptide, nine of eleven composition entries were never touched,
`aa_indices` was checked at one position, the '?' bucket had no coverage, and
`predict_rt` was not exercised at all. Every assertion here exists because a
specific mutation survived without it.

Expected values are written as literals -- absolute indices and pinned model
outputs -- so a permuted element list or a rewritten helper cannot satisfy them
by construction.
