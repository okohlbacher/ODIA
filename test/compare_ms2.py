"""Compare ODIA's predicted fragment spectra against the Python reference.

Covers the inputs the RT model does not have -- charge, NCE and the rank-1
instrument index -- each of which fails silently rather than loudly when wrong:
passing raw NCE gives a spectrum with cosine 0.0028 against the correct one,
and raw charge 0.6377.

Two things this file learned the hard way.

*The cases must reach every channel.* An earlier version varied charge, NCE and
instrument but carried no modification that can lose a neutral fragment, so
channels 4-7 -- the four modloss channels -- were below 5.2e-8 in every case,
25x under the tolerance. Zeroing all four, or swapping them pairwise, passed.
Methionine oxidation is in essentially every real library and puts 36% of the
intensity there, with the base peak in y_modloss_z1. Every channel is now
asserted to be *reached* by at least one case, so a channel cannot quietly
become decoration again.

*The batch must have more than one peptide.* Predicting one at a time leaves
the row striding, the length grouping and the per-peptide charge unexercised:
using charges[0] for every row, or reading every spectrum from output row 0,
passed a suite built on single-peptide calls.
